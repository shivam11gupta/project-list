*) ChangeDetectionStrategy - 
   The @Component decorator accepts a changeDetection option that controls the component's change detection mode. There are two change detection mode options.

ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default is, unsurprisingly, the default strategy. In this mode, Angular checks whether the component's DOM needs an update whenever any activity may have occurred application-wide. Activities that trigger this checking include user interaction, network response, timers, and more.

ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush is an optional mode that reduces the amount of checking Angular needs to perform. In this mode, the framework only checks if a component's DOM needs an update when:

A component input has changes as a result of a binding in a template, or
An event listener in this component runs
The component is explicitly marked for check, via ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck or something which wraps it, like AsyncPipe.
Additionally, when an OnPush component is checked, Angular also checks all of its ancestor components, traversing upwards through the application tree.
