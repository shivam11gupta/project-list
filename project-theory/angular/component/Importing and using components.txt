Angular supports two ways of making a component available to other components: as a standalone component or in an NgModule.

Standalone components - 
A standalone component is a component that sets standalone: true in its component metadata. Standalone components directly import other components, directives, and pipes used in their templates:

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'profile-photo',
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }
@Component({
  standalone: true,
  imports: [ProfilePhoto],
  template: `<profile-photo />`
})
export class UserProfile { }
check
Standalone components are directly importable into other standalone components.

The Angular team recommends using standalone components for all new development.

NgModules
Angular code that predates standalone components uses NgModule as a mechanism for importing and using other components. See the full NgModule guide for details.
