*) The NgOptimizedImage directive makes it easy to adopt performance best practices for loading images.

The directive ensures that the loading of the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) image is prioritized by:

Automatically setting the fetchpriority attribute on the <img> tag
Lazy loading other images by default
Automatically generating a preconnect link tag in the document head
Automatically generating a srcset attribute
Generating a preload hint if app is using SSR

*) Getting Started - 
   a) Import NgOptimizedImage directive - import { NgOptimizedImage } from '@angular/common'
   b) (Optional) Set up a Loader - An image loader is not required in order to use NgOptimizedImage, but using one with an image CDN enables powerful performance features, including automatic srcsets for your images.
   c) Enable the directive - To activate the NgOptimizedImage directive, replace your image's src attribute with ngSrc. ex. - <img ngSrc="cat.jpg">
   d) Mark images as priority - <img ngSrc="cat.jpg" width="400" height="200" priority>
   e) Include Width and Height - <img ngSrc="cat.jpg" width="400" height="200">
   
*) Using fill mode - 
    In cases where you want to have an image fill a containing element, you can use the fill attribute. This is often useful when you want to achieve a "background image" behavior. It can also be helpful when you don't know the exact width and height of your image, but you do have a parent container with a known size that you'd like to fit your image into (see "object-fit" below).
    When you add the fill attribute to your image, you do not need and should not include a width and height, as in this example:
    <img ngSrc="cat.jpg" fill>

*) How to migrate your background image - 
   Here's a simple step-by-step process for migrating from background-image to NgOptimizedImage. For these steps, we'll refer to the element that has an image background as the "containing element":

      Remove the background-image style from the containing element.
      Ensure that the containing element has position: "relative", position: "fixed", or position: "absolute".
      Create a new image element as a child of the containing element, using ngSrc to enable the NgOptimizedImage directive.
      Give that element the fill attribute. Do not include a height and width.
      If you believe this image might be your LCP element, add the priority attribute to the image element.

*) Using placeholders - 
    Automatic placeholders - 
       NgOptimizedImage can display an automatic low-resolution placeholder for your image if you're using a CDN or image host that provides automatic image resizing. Take advantage of this feature by adding the placeholder attribute to your image:
       <img ngSrc="cat.jpg" width="400" height="200" placeholder>. The default size for generated placeholders is 30px wide

*) Data URL placeholders - You can also specify a placeholder using a base64 data URL without an image loader. The data url format is data:image/[imagetype];[data], where [imagetype] is the image format, just as png, and [data] is a base64 encoding of the image. That encoding can be done using the command line or in JavaScript.
                         <img 
  ngSrc="cat.jpg" 
  width="400" 
  height="200" 
  placeholder="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0K..."
/>
