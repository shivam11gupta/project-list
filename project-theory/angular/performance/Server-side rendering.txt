1) Server-side rendering (SSR) is a process that involves rendering pages on the server, resulting in initial HTML content which contains initial page state. Once the HTML content is delivered to a browser, Angular initializes the application and utilizes the data contained within the HTML.
   The main advantages of SSR as compared to client-side rendering (CSR) are:

Improved performance: SSR can improve the performance of web applications by delivering fully rendered HTML to the client, which the browser can parse and display even before it downloads the application JavaScript. This can be especially beneficial for users on low-bandwidth connections or mobile devices.
Improved Core Web Vitals: SSR results in performance improvements that can be measured using Core Web Vitals (CWV) statistics, such as reduced First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), as well as Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).
Better SEO: SSR can improve the search engine optimization (SEO) of web applications by making it easier for search engines to crawl and index the content of the application.

2) Enable server-side rendering
   ng new --ssr
   in existing project - ng add @angular/ssr
To verify that the application is server-side rendered, run it locally with ng serve. The initial HTML request should contain application content.

*) Configure server-side rendering - 
  The server.ts file configures a Node.js Express server and Angular server-side rendering. CommonEngine is used to render an Angular application.
    
*) Hydration - 
   Hydration is the process that restores the server side rendered application on the client. This includes things like reusing the server rendered DOM structures, persisting the application state, transferring application data that was retrieved already by the server, and other processes. Hydration is enabled by default when you use SSR. You can find more info in the hydration guide.

*) Caching data when using HttpClient - 
    HttpClient cached outgoing network requests when running on the server. This information is serialized and transferred to the browser as part of the initial HTML sent from the server. In the browser, HttpClient checks whether it has data in the cache and if so, reuses it instead of making a new HTTP request during initial application rendering. HttpClient stops using the cache once an application becomes stable while running in a browser.

By default, HttpClient caches all HEAD and GET requests which don't contain Authorization or Proxy-Authorization headers. You can override those settings by using withHttpTransferCacheOptions when providing hydration.

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [
    provideClientHydration(withHttpTransferCacheOptions({
      includePostRequests: true
    }))
  ]
});

*) Authoring server-compatible components
   Some common browser APIs and capabilities might not be available on the server. Applications cannot make use of browser-specific global objects like window, document, navigator, or location as well as certain properties of HTMLElement.

In general, code which relies on browser-specific symbols should only be executed in the browser, not on the server. This can be enforced through the afterRender and afterNextRender lifecycle hooks. These are only executed on the browser and skipped on the server.

import { Component, ViewChild, afterNextRender } from '@angular/core';
@Component({
  selector: 'my-cmp',
  template: `<span #content>{{ ... }}</span>`,
})
export class MyComponent {
  @ViewChild('content') contentRef: ElementRef;
  constructor() {
    afterNextRender(() => {
      // Safe to check `scrollHeight` because this will only run in the browser, not the server.
      console.log('content height: ' + this.contentRef.nativeElement.scrollHeight);
    });
  }
}

*) Using Angular Service Worker
If you are using Angular on the server in combination with the Angular service worker, the behavior deviates from the normal server-side rendering behavior. The initial server request will be rendered on the server as expected. However, after that initial request, subsequent requests are handled by the service worker and always client-side rendered.
