*) for example please refer 

*) Wildcard state - An asterisk * or wildcard matches any animation state. ex. - a transition of open => * applies when the element's state changes from open to anything else.
   transition('* => closed', [animate('1s')]),
   transition('* => open', [animate('0.5s')]),
   or double arrow bi directional
   transition('open <=> closed', [animate('0.5s')]),

*) The * => * transition applies when any change between two states takes place.

*) Use wildcards with styles - transition('* => open', [animate('1s', style({opacity: '*'}))]),

*) A transition of * => void applies when the element leaves a view, regardless of what state it was in before it left
A transition of void => * applies when the element enters a view, regardless of what state it assumes when entering
The wildcard state * matches to any state, including void

*) :enter and :leave are aliases for the void => * and * => void transitions.
