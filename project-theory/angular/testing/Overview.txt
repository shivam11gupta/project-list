*) ng test

*) Configuration - 
   The Angular CLI takes care of Jasmine and Karma configuration for you. It constructs the full configuration in memory, based on options specified in the angular.json file.

*) Test file name and location - 
   Inside the src/app folder the Angular CLI generated a test file for the AppComponent named app.component.spec.ts.

*) Testing in continuous integration - 
    ng test --no-watch --no-progress --browsers=ChromeHeadless

*) Find out how much code you're testing - 
   ng test --no-watch --code-coverage
   If you want to create code-coverage reports every time you test, set the following option in the Angular CLI configuration file, angular.json:
   "test": {
  "options": {
    "codeCoverage": true
  }
}

*) Code coverage enforcement - 
   For example, suppose you want the code base to have a minimum of 80% code coverage. To enable this, open the Karma test platform configuration file, karma.conf.js, and add the check property in the coverageReporter: key.
   coverageReporter: {
  dir: require('path').join(__dirname, './coverage/<project-name>'),
  subdir: '.',
  reporters: [
    { type: 'html' },
    { type: 'text-summary' }
  ],
  check: {
    global: {
      statements: 80,
      branches: 80,
      functions: 80,
      lines: 80
    }
  }
}
