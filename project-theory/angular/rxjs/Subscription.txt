*) What is a Subscription? A Subscription is an object that represents a disposable resource, usually the execution of an Observable. A Subscription has one important method, unsubscribe,
   
const observable = interval(1000);
const subscription = observable.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
// Later:
// This cancels the ongoing Observable execution which
// was started by calling subscribe with an Observer.
subscription.unsubscribe();
