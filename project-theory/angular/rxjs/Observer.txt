*) What is an Observer? An Observer is a consumer of values delivered by an Observable. Observers are simply a set of callbacks, one for each type of notification delivered by the Observable: next, error, and complete. The following is an example of a typical Observer object:

content_copyopen_in_new
const observer = {
  next: x => console.log('Observer got a next value: ' + x),
  error: err => console.error('Observer got an error: ' + err),
  complete: () => console.log('Observer got a complete notification'),
};
To use the Observer, provide it to the subscribe of an Observable:

content_copyopen_in_new
observable.subscribe(observer);
Observers are just objects with three callbacks, one for each type of notification that an Observable may deliver.
