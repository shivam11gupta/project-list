*) Deferrable views, also known as @defer blocks, reduce the initial bundle size of your application by deferring the loading of code that is not strictly necessary for the initial rendering of a page. This often results in a faster initial load and improvement in Core Web Vitals (CWV), primarily Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and Time to First Byte (TTFB).
   @defer {
  <large-component />
} @placeholder(minimum 500ms) {   // placeholder will show till when defer block not triggered. and parameter optional minimum used for avoid flicked after setting minimum placeholder time.
  <p>Placeholder content</p>
}

*) The code for any components, directives, and pipes inside of the @defer block is split into a separate JavaScript file and loaded only when necessary, after the rest of the template has been rendered.

*) Which dependencies are deferred? - They must be standalone, They cannot be referenced outside of @defer blocks within the same file

*) It is not rendered initiallyâ€“ deferred content loads and renders once the specified trigger occurs or the when condition is met.
   By default, a @defer block is triggered when the browser state becomes idle.

*) The @loading block is an optional block that allows you to declare content that is shown while deferred dependencies are loading. It replaces the @placeholder block once loading is triggered.
   @defer {
  <large-component />
} @loading (after 100ms; minimum 1s){
  <img alt="loading..." src="loading.gif" />
} @placeholder {
  <p>Placeholder content</p>
} @error {   // The @error block is an optional block that displays if deferred loading fails. 
  <p>Failed to load large component.</p>
}

*) Controlling deferred content loading with triggers - 
   
Trigger	Description
idle	   Triggers when the browser is idle. 
viewport	Triggers when specified content enters the viewport. @defer (on viewport). The viewport trigger loads the deferred content when the specified content enters the viewport using the Intersection Observer API
interact Triggers when the user interacts with specified element. @defer (on interaction). when the user interacts with the specified element through click or keydown events.
hover	   Triggers when the mouse hovers over specified area.  @defer (on hover) hover on triggered area
immedia  Triggers immediately after non-deferred content has finished rendering
timer	   Triggers after a specific duration. @defer (on timer(500ms)) // The timer trigger loads the deferred content after a specified duration.

*) The when trigger accepts a custom conditional expression and loads the deferred content when the condition becomes truthy.
   @defer (when condition)
