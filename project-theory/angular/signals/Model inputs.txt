*) import {Component, model, input} from '@angular/core';
@Component({...})
export class CustomCheckbox {
  // This is a model input.
  checked = model(false);
  // This is a standard input.
  disabled = input(false);

*) Both input() and model() functions are ways to define signal-based inputs in Angular, but they differ in a few ways:

model() defines both an input and an output. The output's name is always the name of the input suffixed with Change to support two-way bindings. It will be up to the consumer of your directive to decide if they want to use just the input, just the output, or both.
ModelSignal is a WritableSignal which means that its value can be changed from anywhere using the set and update methods. When a new value is assigned, the ModelSignal will emit to its output. This is different from InputSignal which is read-only and can only be changed through the template.
Model inputs do not support input transforms while signal inputs do.
