*) ng add @angular/localize

*) Refer to locales by ID -
   Angular uses the Unicode locale identifier (Unicode locale ID) to find the correct locale data for internationalization of text strings.
   A locale ID specifies the language, country, and an optional code for further variants or subdivisions. A locale ID consists of the language identifier, a hyphen (-) character, and the locale extension.
   {language_id}-{locale_extension}

*) Set the source locale ID
Use the Angular CLI to set the source language in which you are writing the component template and code.

By default, Angular uses en-US as the source locale of your project.

To change the source locale of your project for the build, complete the following actions.

Open the angular.json workspace build configuration file.
Change the source locale in the sourceLocale field.
