*) no need any practical

*) JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file.
   
*) The Rules of JSX - 
    1. Return a single root element - 
       To return multiple elements from a component, wrap them with a single parent tag. ex. - <>
  <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
  <img 
    src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
    alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
    class="photo"
  >
  <ul>
    ...
  </ul>
</>
This empty tag is called a Fragment. Fragments let you group things without leaving any trace in the browser HTML tree.
    
    2. Close all the tags.

    3. camelCase all most of the things!
