*) theory enough not need practice

*) Exporting and importing multiple components from the same file
   gallery.js file - 
     export function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/QIrZWGIs.jpg"
      alt="Alan L. Hart"
    />
  );
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}

app.js file - 
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';
import { Profile } from './Gallery.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Profile />
  );
}

Gallery.js:
Exports the Profile component as a named export called Profile.
Exports the Gallery component as a default export.
App.js:
Imports Profile as a named import called Profile from Gallery.js.
Imports Gallery as a default import from Gallery.js.
Exports the root App component as a default export.
