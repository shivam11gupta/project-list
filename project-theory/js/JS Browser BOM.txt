*) The window object is supported by all browsers. It represents the browser's window.

*) window.document.getElementById("header");
is the same as:
document.getElementById("header");

*) document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"Page hostname is " + window.location.hostname;
Result is:

Page hostname is www.w3schools.com

*) The window.navigator object contains information about the visitor's browser.
   The cookieEnabled property returns true if cookies are enabled, otherwise false:

Example
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"cookiesEnabled is " + navigator.cookieEnabled;
</script>

*) JavaScript has three kind of popup boxes: Alert box, Confirm box, and Prompt box.

*) An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.
   When an alert box pops up, the user will have to click "OK" to proceed.
   window.alert("sometext");

*) A confirm box is often used if you want the user to verify or accept something.
   When a confirm box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed.
  if (confirm("Press a button!")) {
  txt = "You pressed OK!";
} else {
  txt = "You pressed Cancel!";
}

*) A prompt box is often used if you want the user to input a value before entering a page.
   When a prompt box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed after entering an input value.
    let person = prompt("Please enter your name", "Harry Potter");
let text;
if (person == null || person == "") {
  text = "User cancelled the prompt.";
} else {
  text = "Hello " + person + "! How are you today?";
}

*) <button onclick="setTimeout(myFunction, 3000)">Try it</button>

<script>
function myFunction() {
  alert('Hello');
}
</script>

*) The clearTimeout() method stops the execution of the function specified in setTimeout().
   myVar = setTimeout(function, milliseconds);
clearTimeout(myVar);

*) window.setInterval(function, milliseconds);
   setInterval(myTimer, 1000);
function myTimer() {
  const d = new Date();
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = d.toLocaleTimeString();
}

*) Cookies are data, stored in small text files, on your computer.
When a web server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down, and the server forgets everything about the user.
Cookies were invented to solve the problem "how to remember information about the user":
When a user visits a web page, his/her name can be stored in a cookie.
Next time the user visits the page, the cookie "remembers" his/her name.

*) You can also add an expiry date (in UTC time). By default, the cookie is deleted when the browser is closed:
   document.cookie = "username=John Doe; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2013 12:00:00 UTC";

*) Read a Cookie with JavaScript - 
   let x = document.cookie;

*) Change a Cookie with JavaScript
   With JavaScript, you can change a cookie the same way as you create it:
   document.cookie = "username=John Smith; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2013 12:00:00 UTC; path=/";

*) Delete a Cookie with JavaScript -
   You don't have to specify a cookie value when you delete a cookie. Just set the expires parameter to a past date,
   document.cookie = "username=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;";
